## ✨ What's the Point?

This project was all about *flexing those frontend muscles* — no frameworks, no shortcuts, just raw code and vibes. It’s an exercise in:

- 🎯 Reverse-engineering a complex UI
- 🎯 Recreating responsive layouts that *actually* behave well
- 🎯 Mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox
- 🎯 Adding little UX joys like tooltips, buttons, and hover effects

Perfect for learning UI/UX through cloning real-world platforms.
